* Objective
  - To perform the Simulation of the "Identification of finger print patterns" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/anthropology-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Identification of finger print patterns/Identification of finger print patterns_01_Usability_smk.org][Identification of finger print patterns_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Stay on the images and count the amount of whorls, loops & arches.
  4. Enter the amount into the boxes
  5. Write the population type into the type box
  6. Click on the submit button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new page should be opened with the simulation process
  4. If the enrtered values are correct an successful message should be displayed on the screen, if not an wrong message should be displayed on the screen
