* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Calculation of Indices experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/anthropology-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Calculation of Indices/Calculation of Indices_01_Usability_smk.org][Calculation of Indices_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Select Nasal Index
  4. Drag & set the dots one by one at proper points.
  5. Drag the ruler & measure the maximum cranial length (g-op) & maximum cranial breadth (eu-eu) and click on next button
  6. Don't enter the measured amount value into the provided box and click on calculate button.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A page should be opened with the simulation process
