* Objective
  - To perform the Simulation of the Obtain the main line formula experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/anthropology-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Obtain the main line formula/Obtain the main line formula_01_Usability_smk.org][Obtain the main line formula_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Drag & drop the following symbols to identify the digital triradii
  4. Click next button
