* Objective
  - To perfor the Simulation of the Skeleton - Assembling, Identification & labeling experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/anthropology-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Skeleton - Assembling, Identification & labeling/Skeleton - Assembling, Identification & labeling_01_Usability_smk.org][Skeleton - Assembling, Identification & labeling_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on 'Skeleton-Assembling' link
  4. Don't drag all the parts and set at accurate place to complete the skeleton structure and click on submit button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A page should be opened with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to set all the parts

* Review/comments
